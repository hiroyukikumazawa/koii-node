# Welcome to the Koii Network!

Koii is a community of people and computers, working together to build a brighter, more secure, more private future. The global network allows anyone to use a few lines of code to access personal computers instead of paying Big Tech‚Ñ¢ to do what you need.

## ‚ÄúWhat exactly is a Koii node?‚Äù

A Koii node is a very small computer program‚Äîabout the same size as your favorite music playing app‚Äîthat allows you to run compute jobs called ‚Äútasks‚Äù for people around the world. They pay you to rent the extra space, like Uber for your computer, but it stays on your desk at all times.

A task can be anything from hosting a website to grabbing information from anywhere on the internet, or processing lots of data. The possibilities are endless.

## The Benefits

### Earn while you sleep!
Each task you run rewards you with tokens, paying you for using your extra compute power. The more tasks you complete, the more you can earn.

### Support a community you love
Devote your device to working for a community you care about. There are many types of resources organizations need and one of those is compute power! Help host a website and accomplish other goals.

### Enable cheaper, easier, and better applications
Koii‚Äôs compute marketplace uses computers just like yours to make creating better applications not only possible, but the smart choice.
- Because tasks use excess compute power, they don‚Äôt have to pay to rent expensive hardware.
- Koii apps have better privacy, content ownership, and data security by default.
- Building apps with Koii tools means you get all of the benefits of Web3, and get to work in JavaScript.


### The internet‚Äôs wealth belongs to everyone on the internet
If you contribute to the internet, you should earn from it. Help us shift the status quo from creating wealth for people in Silicon Valley to creating wealth for everyone who contributes.

## Why Koii?
The world is changing fast. There are a few big directions technology is moving in and Koii‚Äôs tools and tech are at the forefront. Start running a node so you can be part of the revolution and earn tokens while you do it!
